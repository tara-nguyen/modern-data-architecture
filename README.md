The purpose of this repo is to recreate the code in the book *Modern Data Architectures with Python: A practical guide to building and deploying data pipelines, data warehouses and data lakes* by Brian Lipp (2023). However, note that some of the code in the book requires the use of AWS and Databricks, which are not free. Therefore, materials involving these two services are omitted from this repo. A note is included in the notebooks where this omission happens.
